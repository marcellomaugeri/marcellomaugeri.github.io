During middle school, I delved into HTML and CCS, creating websites and forums. I even attempted my first videogame prototype with RPG Maker, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with Ruby scripting. However, it was in high school, at the technical institute “E. Fermi - R. Guttuso”, that I began studying Computer Science, learning the fundamentals of programming, networking, and databases.\nIn 2016, immediately after high school, I enrolled at the University of Catania to pursue my Computer Science studies. I earned my bachelor’s degree in 2019 with the thesis “Smart Hub and 3DCP - Dynamic Domotic Device”, for which I received full marks, under the supervision of prof. Corrado Santoro and prof. Federico Santoro. Continuing my studies, I pursued a master’s degree in Security and Network Systems. During my Master’s degree, I broadened my horizons through the Erasmus program at University College Dublin (Ireland) for a semester. I also interned at Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), where I worked on my first article “Embedded fuzzing: a review of challenges, tools, and solutions”, , published in the Springer Cybersecurity journal. In 2021, I worked on my master thesis, titled “Shared Memory Fuzzing”, at the Bosch Campus for Research and Advance Engineering in Renningen. Once again, I graduated with a final mark of 110/110 cum laude.\nWhile working on my master thesis, I came across the article “Fuzzing: Challenges and Reflections”, which inspired my PhD research project. Currently, I am researching ways to enhance the automation of fuzzing in terms of applicability over complex systems. Specifically, I am intrigued by the idea of employing fuzzing on multiprocess systems and web servers, from embedded devices to cloud APIs. I am pursuing my PhD studies at the University of Catania since the end of 2021, in the Network and Security Informatics research group led by prof. Giampaolo Bella, who serves as my supervisor. Last but not least, I am delighted to be on a research visit at King’s College London under the guidance of Prof. Fabio Pierazzi.\n","date":1709078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1709078400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"My passion for technology began when I got my first computer (Windows 95!) at the tender age of 4.

Robust security testing methods are essential to fortify devices against potential threats. While dynamic analysis techniques, such as fuzzing, help identify vulnerabilities, some challenges arise due to diverse architectures, communication channels and protocols. Testing directly on devices overcomes difficulties in firmware emulation, but lack of protocol standardisation still poses hurdles. The recently released Matter protocol aims to unify smart home ecosystems, thus also simplifying security testing. In particular, Matter inherits the concept of Cluster from Zigbee in its Data Model. The Data Model clearly defines attributes, commands, status codes and events that could be leveraged to design automated security testing techniques such as fuzzing. This paper proposes the design of a fuzzing framework for Matter-enabled smart home devices. The framework employs stateful fuzzing to cover the inherent state-fullness of IoT devices. Such a framework would bestow benefits upon manufacturers, researchers, and end-users.","tags":["Fuzzing","IoT","Security Testing"],"title":"Fuzzing Matter(s): A White Paper for Fuzzing the Matter Protocol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Maugeri","Cristian Daniele","Giampaolo Bella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705622400,"objectID":"a9b64c9758f5ea46378cbfb749c65272","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/publication/3-forkfuzz/","publishdate":"2024-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/3-forkfuzz/","section":"publication","summary":"Fuzzing is a widely adopted technique for automated vulnerability testing due to its effectiveness and applicability throughout the Software Development Life Cycle. Nevertheless, applying fuzzing 'out of the box' to any system can prove to be a challenging endeavour. Consequently, the demand for target-specific solutions necessitates a substantial amount of manual intervention, which diverges from the automated nature typically associated with fuzzing. For example, prior research identified the lack of a solution for testing multi-process systems effectively. The problem is that coverage-guided fuzzers do not consider the possibility of having a system with more than one process. In this paper, we present Forkfuzz, a 'fork-aware' fuzzer able to deal with multi-process systems. To the best of our knowledge, Forkfuzz is the first fork-aware fuzzer. It is built on top of Honggfuzz, one of the most popular and effective coverage-guided fuzzers, as reported by the Fuzzbench benchmark. To show its effectiveness, we tested our fuzzer over two classical programming problems: the Dining Philosophers Problem and a version of the Producer-Consumer Problem where the consumer (the child) process crashes for specific inputs. Furthermore, we evaluated Forkfuzz against a real and more complex scenario involving an HTTP server that handles multiple connections through multiple processes. The results of our evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of Forkfuzz in identifying crashes and timeouts. Finally, we discuss possible improvements and challenges for the development and application of fork-aware fuzzing techniques.","tags":["Fuzzing","Automated Vulnerability Testing","Multi-Process System","Security Testing","Concurrent Programming"],"title":"Forkfuzz: Leveraging the Fork-Awareness in Coverage-Guided Fuzzing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"b69597c709c41da24f510507988b30c7","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/project/thewatercode/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/thewatercode/","section":"project","summary":"The initiative is part of the project 'The water code (TWC).

It consists of feeding a software under test with malformed inputs, waiting for a weird system behaviour (often a crash of the system). Over the years, different approaches have been developed, and among the most popular lies the coverage-based one. It relies on the instrumentation of the system to generate inputs able to cover as much code as possible. The success of this approach is also due to its usability as fuzzing techniques research approaches that do not require (or only partial require) human interactions. Despite the efforts, devising a fully-automated fuzzer still seems to be a challenging task. Target systems may be very complex; they may integrate cryptographic primitives, compute and verify check-sums and employ forks to enhance the system security, achieve better performances or manage different connections at the same time. This paper introduces the fork-awareness property to express the fuzzer ability to manage systems using forks. This property is leveraged to evaluate 14 of the most widely coverage-guided fuzzers and highlight how current fuzzers are ineffective against systems using forks.","tags":["Fuzzing","Fork","Security Testing","Software Security"],"title":"Evaluating the Fork-Awareness of Coverage-Guided Fuzzers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giampaolo Bella","Salvatore Riccobene","Gaetano Puccia","Ivan Mercanti","Gianpietro Castiglione","Mario Raciti","Cristian Daniele","Sergio Esposito","Marcello Maugeri","Davide Micale"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671548400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671548400,"objectID":"496efbf60cb8ddb89fe3e3ac97155edf","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/talk/wsf22-the-2022-workshop-on-security-frameworks-security-testing/","publishdate":"2022-12-20T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/wsf22-the-2022-workshop-on-security-frameworks-security-testing/","section":"event","summary":"WSF22 - The 2022 edition - 20th edition in the series!","tags":[],"title":"WSF22 - The 2022 Workshop on Security Frameworks \"Security Testing\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Giampaolo Bella","Pietro Biondi","Davide Micale","Sergio Esposito","Marcello Maugeri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653476400,"objectID":"53b6f15cb8e4518a969e79ad2f388cdf","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/talk/hardening-six-the-ava-event/","publishdate":"2022-05-25T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/hardening-six-the-ava-event/","section":"event","summary":"AvA is a hot attack against Amazon Echo, published after over a year of responsible disclosure with Amazon.","tags":[],"title":"Hardening Six - The AvA event","type":"event"},{"authors":["Max Eisele","Marcello Maugeri","Rachna Shriwas","Christopher Huth","Giampaolo Bella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648166400,"objectID":"ace9e7d974c6cbf2c167c6605c3014bb","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/publication/1-embedded/","publishdate":"2022-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/1-embedded/","section":"publication","summary":"Fuzzing has become one of the best-established methods to uncover software bugs. Meanwhile, the market of embedded systems, which binds the software execution tightly to the very hardware architecture, has grown at a steady pace, and that pace is anticipated to become yet more sustained in the near future. Embedded systems also beneft from fuzzing, but the innumerable existing architectures and hardware peripherals complicate the development of general and usable approaches, hence a plethora of tools have recently appeared. Here comes a stringent need for a systematic review in the area of fuzzing approaches for embedded systems, which we term “embedded fuzzing” for brevity. The inclusion criteria chosen in this article are semi-objective in their coverage of the most relevant publication venues as well as of our personal judgement. The review rests on a formal defnition we develop to represent the realm of embedded fuzzing. It continues by discussing the approaches that satisfy the inclusion criteria, then defnes the relevant elements of comparison and groups the approaches according to how the execution environment is served to the system under test. The resulting review produces a table with 42 entries, which in turn supports discussion suggesting vast room for future research due to the limitations noted.","tags":["Embedded systems","Dynamic analysis","Vulnerability mining","Embedded security","Software security"],"title":"Embedded fuzzing: a review of challenges, tools, and solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Do you need to create the right atmosphere and break the ice with people you don’t know or are you just going to spend the evening at home with friends, avoiding being on the sofa to watch yet another movie while munching popcorn? ou can have fun even without drinking, but why risk it?
