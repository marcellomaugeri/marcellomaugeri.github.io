      <title>Dragomanni Apartments</title>
      <link>https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/project/dragomanni/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apartments with garden for rent in the historic centre of Florence, in Via deâ€™ Guicciardini, inside Palazzo Dragomanni. Between Ponte Vecchio and Palazzo Pitti there are two beautiful apartments with contemporary furnishings and fine finishes immersed in an oasis of tranquillity, completely renovated and intended for short or medium-term rental. These apartments represent a rarity also considering the large private garden of 400 smq at their disposal and their strategic location in the historical centre of the city. The stay is assured in absolute silence, surrounded by nature, art and culture. Palazzo Dragomanni is crossed by the Vasari Corridor that connects Palazzo Vecchio, the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti. The two apartments are less than 100 m from Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Pitti and the Boboli Gardens. Florence is a small enough city to be admired walking with tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distantia (iOS app)</title>
      <link>https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/en/project/distantia/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been named &amp;lsquo;Distantia&amp;rsquo; and will automatically detect compliance with the safety distance between people. The app was developed by students Fabrizio Billeci, Giuseppe Criscione and Marcello Maugeri in response to a call published by the University of Catania&amp;rsquo;s Department of Mathematics and Informatics&amp;rsquo; lecturers Sebastiano Battiato (delegate for Information Systems and Strategic Planning) and Filippo Stanco (delegate for Communication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Distantia&amp;rsquo; app, in full respect of privacy, once installed on one&amp;rsquo;s mobile phone, automatically detects the presence of other devices via the Bluetooth signal, signalling with a special sound signal any excessive proximity. The intensity of the signal, in fact, allows an approximate estimate of the relative distance, acting as a &amp;lsquo;rigorous&amp;rsquo; and highly effective controller in future primary and secondary prevention strategies in the health and social spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
