Meanwhile, the market of embedded systems, which binds the software execution tightly to the very hardware architecture, has grown at a steady pace, and that pace is anticipated to become yet more sustained in the near future. Embedded systems also beneft from fuzzing, but the innumerable existing architectures and hardware peripherals complicate the development of general and usable approaches, hence a plethora of tools have recently appeared. Here comes a stringent need for a systematic review in the area of fuzzing approaches for embedded systems, which we term ‚Äúembedded fuzzing‚Äù for brevity. The inclusion criteria chosen in this article are semi-objective in their coverage of the most relevant publication venues as well as of our personal judgement. The review rests on a formal defnition we develop to represent the realm of embedded fuzzing. It continues by discussing the approaches that satisfy the inclusion criteria, then defnes the relevant elements of comparison and groups the approaches according to how the execution environment is served to the system under test. The resulting review produces a table with 42 entries, which in turn supports discussion suggesting vast room for future research due to the limitations noted.","tags":["Embedded systems","Dynamic analysis","Vulnerability mining","Embedded security","Software security"],"title":"Embedded fuzzing: a review of challenges, tools, and solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Do you need to create the right atmosphere and break the ice with people you don‚Äôt know or are you just going to spend the evening at home with friends, avoiding being on the sofa to watch yet another movie while munching popcorn? ou can have fun even without drinking, but why risk it?

Between Ponte Vecchio and Palazzo Pitti there are two beautiful apartments with contemporary furnishings and fine finishes immersed in an oasis of tranquillity, completely renovated and intended for short or medium-term rental. These apartments represent a rarity also considering the large private garden of 400 smq at their disposal and their strategic location in the historical centre of the city. The stay is assured in absolute silence, surrounded by nature, art and culture. Palazzo Dragomanni is crossed by the Vasari Corridor that connects Palazzo Vecchio, the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti. The two apartments are less than 100 m from Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Pitti and the Boboli Gardens. Florence is a small enough city to be admired walking with tranquility.\n","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"1840b505be6c49118dbfb38906b08ace","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/project/dragomanni/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dragomanni/","section":"project","summary":"Website of the Dragomanni Palace in Florence","tags":["Dev"],"title":"Dragomanni Apartments","type":"project"},{"authors":["Marcello Maugeri","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
