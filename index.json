[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Born in 1997 in Giarre (CT), I had my first computer with Windows 95 when I was only four years old. I guess my interest for technology started from there. After the middle school I embraced videogame developing by creating my first videogame prototype with RPG maker. I then started to study Computer Science during the highschool at the technical institute “E. Fermi - R. Guttuso” where I learned the basics of programming, networking and databases.\nIn 2016, right after the highschool, I immediately enrolled at the University of Catania to pursue my Computer Science studies. I got my bachelor degree in 2019 with the thesis “Smart Hub and 3DCP - Dynamic Domotic Device” thanks to which I got full marks. Subsequently, I continued my studies with a master degree in Security and Network Systems. During my Master’s degree I had the opportunity to broaden my horizons by participating in the Erasmus programme at University College Dublin (Ireland) for a semester. I also had the opportunity to do an internship in Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany) where I worked on my first article “Embedded fuzzing: a review of challenges, tools, and solutions”, published in Springer Cybersecurity journal.In 2021, I had the opportunity to work on my master thesis, with title “Shared Memory Fuzzing”, in the Bosch Campus for Research and Advance Engineering in Renningen. Again, I graduated with a final mark of 110/110 cum laude.\nNow I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Catania from the end of 2021. I am currently researching on improving the automation of fuzzing in terms of applicability. I am also interested in the IoT Security and Quantum Security fields. I am a member of the Network and Security Informatics research group led by prof. Giampaolo Bella, which is my supervisor.\n","date":1653476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1653476400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Born in 1997 in Giarre (CT), I had my first computer with Windows 95 when I was only four years old.

Meanwhile, the market of embedded systems, which binds the software execution tightly to the very hardware architecture, has grown at a steady pace, and that pace is anticipated to become yet more sustained in the near future. Embedded systems also beneft from fuzzing, but the innumerable existing architectures and hardware peripherals complicate the development of general and usable approaches, hence a plethora of tools have recently appeared. Here comes a stringent need for a systematic review in the area of fuzzing approaches for embedded systems, which we term “embedded fuzzing” for brevity. The inclusion criteria chosen in this article are semi-objective in their coverage of the most relevant publication venues as well as of our personal judgement. The review rests on a formal defnition we develop to represent the realm of embedded fuzzing. It continues by discussing the approaches that satisfy the inclusion criteria, then defnes the relevant elements of comparison and groups the approaches according to how the execution environment is served to the system under test. The resulting review produces a table with 42 entries, which in turn supports discussion suggesting vast room for future research due to the limitations noted.","tags":["Embedded systems","Dynamic analysis","Vulnerability mining","Embedded security","Software security"],"title":"Embedded fuzzing: a review of challenges, tools, and solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Do you need to create the right atmosphere and break the ice with people you don’t know or are you just going to spend the evening at home with friends, avoiding being on the sofa to watch yet another movie while munching popcorn? ou can have fun even without drinking, but why risk it?

Between Ponte Vecchio and Palazzo Pitti there are two beautiful apartments with contemporary furnishings and fine finishes immersed in an oasis of tranquillity, completely renovated and intended for short or medium-term rental. These apartments represent a rarity also considering the large private garden of 400 smq at their disposal and their strategic location in the historical centre of the city. The stay is assured in absolute silence, surrounded by nature, art and culture. Palazzo Dragomanni is crossed by the Vasari Corridor that connects Palazzo Vecchio, the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti. The two apartments are less than 100 m from Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Pitti and the Boboli Gardens. Florence is a small enough city to be admired walking with tranquility.\n","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"1840b505be6c49118dbfb38906b08ace","permalink":"https://marcellomaugeri.github.io/project/dragomanni/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dragomanni/","section":"project","summary":"Website of the Dragomanni Palace in Florence","tags":["Dev"],"title":"Dragomanni Apartments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It has been named ‘Distantia’ and will automatically detect compliance with the safety distance between people.
